# CognOS Development Changelog

## Session 1 - Initial Project Setup (2025-07-05)

### Summary
Complete initial project setup for CognOS - an AI-augmented operating system layer for Raspberry Pi. Established monorepo structure, core architecture, and development workflow.

### Key Decisions Made

1. **Architecture Decision**: Custom Shell Replacement
   - Chosen approach: Create `cognos-shell` executable that replaces user's default shell
   - Alternative approaches considered: Shell wrapper script, shell hook integration
   - Rationale: Provides seamless integration as default shell from system startup

2. **Project Structure**: Monorepo
   - Single repository containing all components (shell, agent, tools, UI)
   - Justified by tight coupling between components and single deployment target

3. **Technology Stack**:
   - **AI Model**: Mistral 7B Q4/Q5 quantized via llama.cpp
   - **Shell**: Python-based custom shell with command interception
   - **UI**: Future GTK/QT desktop overlay
   - **Configuration**: JSON-based with user/system config hierarchy

### Files Created

- Every time code changes are made (excluding documentation-only changes), add the changes to this changelog with details about what was modified and why.

## Session 2 - Architecture Documentation Expansion (2025-07-06)

### Summary
Expanded CognOS documentation to cover two distinct deployment models: prototype Raspberry Pi OS image and full Linux distribution. This session clarified the evolution from "layer on existing OS" to comprehensive deployment strategies.

### Key Architectural Decisions

1. **Dual Deployment Strategy**
   - **Prototype Model**: Pre-configured Raspberry Pi OS image for demos and testing
   - **Distribution Model**: Complete custom Linux OS for production deployment
   - Both models maintain core CognOS Agent architecture but target different use cases

2. **Documentation Structure**
   - Created comprehensive documentation for both deployment models
   - Maintained alignment with existing codebase architecture
   - Clear separation of concerns between prototype and production approaches

### Files Created

#### COGNOS_PROTOTYPE.md
- Complete documentation for Raspberry Pi OS image approach
- Based on existing README.md and development-setup.md content
- Emphasizes demo/testing focus with pre-installed CognOS layer
- Covers installation, configuration, and development workflow
- Scope: CognOS as pre-installed layer on Raspberry Pi OS

#### COGNOS_DISTRIBUTION.md  
- Comprehensive documentation for full Linux distribution
- Enterprise-grade features and production deployment focus
- Cloud integration, container orchestration, and enterprise security
- Multi-platform support (x86_64, ARM64, RISC-V)
- Scope: CognOS as complete operating system replacement

### Architecture Alignment

Both documentation files maintain consistency with existing codebase:
- **Core Components**: Shell replacement, AI agent, tool system, safety layer
- **AI Engine**: Mistral 7B Q4/Q5 with llama.cpp integration  
- **Development Phases**: Aligned with Phase 1-3 roadmap from README.md
- **Tool Ecosystem**: search_folder, list_options, run_command, create_env, switch_env
- **Configuration**: JSON-based config system in ~/.config/cognos/

### Development Context Preservation

Documentation maintains full context for development continuation:
- Raspberry Pi 5 as primary development target
- VS Code Remote SSH development workflow
- Mac + Pi development environment setup
- Git workflow and repository structure
- Custom shell replacement implementation approach

### Documentation Refactoring

#### README.md Restructure
- **Removed Redundancy**: Eliminated detailed implementation details covered in other .md files
- **Focus Shift**: Changed from "General Development Plan" to project overview and repository guide
- **Clear Navigation**: Added links to specialized documentation (PROTOTYPE.md, DISTRIBUTION.md, development-setup.md)
- **Repository-Centric**: Emphasized codebase structure, quick start, and contribution workflow
- **Concise Architecture**: High-level architecture overview with links to detailed specs

#### Content Reorganization
- **Project Overview**: Clear deployment model distinction with direct links
- **Repository Structure**: Visual directory tree for code navigation
- **Core Architecture**: Concise technical overview without implementation details
- **Quick Start**: Practical commands for immediate project engagement
- **Development Links**: Centralized navigation to all development documentation

This refactoring eliminates redundancy between README.md and the specialized deployment documentation while maintaining clear project navigation and onboarding flow.

## Session 3 - Phase 1 Development Start (2025-07-06)

### Development Environment Issues and Fixes

#### Requirements.txt Optimization for Pi Development
- **Issue**: PyQt5 compilation failed on Raspberry Pi during initial setup
- **Solution**: Streamlined requirements.txt for Phase 1 development focus
- **Changes**:
  - Removed PyQt5 and heavy UI dependencies (moved to Phase 3)
  - Removed transformers and torch (not needed for initial llama.cpp integration)
  - Removed numpy (llama-cpp-python handles its own dependencies)
  - Kept core dependencies: llama-cpp-python, requests, pyyaml, pytest, psutil
- **Rationale**: Focus on core AI functionality first, add UI/ML dependencies in later phases

#### Development Strategy
- **Phase 1 Focus**: Get llama.cpp + basic agent working without UI complexity
- **Incremental Approach**: Add dependencies as needed for each phase
